                        We truly believe that yoga is for everyone. There are so many different types of yoga out there,
                        you just have to find what is right for you. That is why we offer a wide range of classes from
                        basics to power yoga.

                            <p>
                                If words like 'downward dog,' 'vinyasa,' or 'chataranga' leave you feeling confused,
                                then this is the class for you. This class will help you get started in the world of
                                yoga through detailed instructions and beginner poses. It's a great refresher for
                                existing students too.
                                <br><br>
                                Basic yoga poses, proper alignment, the benefits of proper breathing, use of props,
                                breathing techniques, and relaxation are taught and explored.
                                <br><br>
                                This class is a great confidence booster for any level of practice - old or new to the
                                yoga world. No heat. Beginners welcome.

                            <p>
                                Stressed? We’ve got a class for that. This mellow class places special emphasis on the
                                coordination of movement with breath and focuses on relaxing gentle movements, deep
                                stretches, muscle release, and restorative postures to help your whole body untangle and
                                unwind.
                                <br><br>
                                Props are often used to help support the body specifically on areas like shoulders,
                                hips, hamstrings, and the spine. Postures are held much longer to help you tap into
                                connective tissue, giving you a greater release.
                                <br><br>
                                No yoga experience required. All levels welcome - Ideal for beginners, seniors, and
                                those with injuries or other physical limitations.

                                Similar to our Yoga Flow class, Slow Flow focuses on using our breath to connect with
                                our bodies, mindful movements, and creative sequencing, but at a slightly slower pace.
                                Flow through the practice to strengthen, detoxify, and re-energize your body.
                                <br><br>
                                Movements will be mild, sometimes held longer, with plenty of time for transitions and
                                adjustments.
